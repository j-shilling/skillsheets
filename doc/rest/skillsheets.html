<h1>REST Interface - SkillSheets</h1>

<p>SkillSheets are a user resource used to group course objectives and track student 
progress. The REST interface enables CRUD operations upon this resource. All operations
must be performed by authenticated users. Authentication is performed on the client
using <a href=https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in>Google Sign-In</a>.
The client needs to get an <a href=https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/backend-auth>
id token</a> and attach it to each request as a header parameter called 'Id-Token'. If the
server is unable to validate the id token, a status code of 401 is returned. If the id token
is valid, but the user is trying to perform an operation for which they do not have permission,
a status code of 403 is returned. Some operations require that a UUID be sent as path parameter;
if this UUID does not correspond to an existing object, 404 is returned.</p>
